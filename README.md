# About

"ROOMs" is set within a 12x12 meter cube in Decentraland, a limitation that inspired the creation of a virtual world within a virtual world. Utilizing the theme of exploration, this installation invites visitors to traverse through endless rooms, each offering unique, dynamic sculptures and environments generated through a combination of geometrical patterns and motion systems.

### Key Features:

- Procedural Generation: Artworks within the rooms are created in real-time, using a mix of geometrical shapes and predetermined movements to ensure that no two visits are the same.
- AI Voice: An AI narrator guides the experience, as if evolving in response to the visitor's interactions. This voice adds a layer of narrative, becoming more philosophical and introspective as the journey progresses.
- Interactive Dynamics: The installation explores the relationship between observer and observed, questioning the nature of interaction within virtual spaces.
